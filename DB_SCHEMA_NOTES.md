do we want to store a User's website? (ig users can edit their bio to add any link they want)

do we want to do bookmarks? (ig users can bookmark posts and have a 'bookmark'/'saved' section that they can go to)

polymorphic relationship for likes or should we have separate join tables for post_likes and comment_likes or something?

how do we do carousels? store an array of multiple image urls?

group message names should be nullable since you don't have to name a gc? but you can if you want?

replies to comments?
